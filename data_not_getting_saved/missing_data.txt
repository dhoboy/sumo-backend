I am only missing the data from Sept 2021, day 14. that json file is not on
nhk.

for some reason, my download code only downloads the first 13 days of a basho,
it never downloads days 14 or 15, even if their files are on nhk. will look
into this

-- seems to be the function that starts the channels code returns before days 14
and 15 can finish, and the attempt to keep the channels referenced by something
with the
(swap!
    jobs
    merge
    {:fetch (fetch-data)
     :update (update-data)
     :write (write-data)})

in (start-data-pipeline is doing nothing
